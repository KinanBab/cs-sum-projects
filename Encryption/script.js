// Look at https://github.com/wwwtyro/cryptico
// Cryptico is the library we will use for encryption and decryption.
// The url will show you the source code (files) of cryptico inside a table.
// Below the table you will find a short tutorial with examples.
// Read the help to find out how to use cryptico for:
//  1. generate an RSA key from passkey and number of bits.
//  2. encrypt text with RSA key.
//  3. decrypt text with RSA key.


// You will also have to look online for brief (1-2 paragraphs each) answers to the following questions:
//  1. What is cryptography?
//  2. What is encryption?
//  3. List 2 famous encryption algorithms.
//  4. What is the difference between symmetric encryption and public-private key encryption?
//  5. Give 2 examples of where encryption is used.


function encrypt() {
  // Get the passkey, bit length, and input from the html
  
  // Use Cryptico to generate the RSA Key from the passkey and bits.
  
  // Use Cryptico to encrypt the value of input using the Public Key part of the RSA Key.
  
  // Put the final result in the output textarea in the html.
  
}

function decrypt() {
  // Get the passkey, bit length, and input from the html
  
  // Use Cryptico to generate the RSA Key from the passkey and bits.
  
  // Use Cryptico to decrypt the value of input using the RSA Key.
  
  // Put the final result in the output textarea in the html.
